# What is Formy ?

Formy is a react library designed for integrating form validation easily. Formy takes a state and regex for each input and validates `onTouch` and `active` states while the user is typing.

Formy is very flexible and does not take over your whole form, but rather handles individual inputs, which makes it easy to integrate into any project
